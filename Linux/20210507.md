1. Create a directory in your home directory called projects. In the projects
directory, create nine empty fi les that are named house1, house2, house3, and so on to house9. 
Assuming there are lots of other files in that directory, come up with a single argument to ls that would list just those nine files.

[JuliaOliver@localhost ~]$ pwd <br />
/home/JuliaOliver <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost ~]$ mkdir Projects <br /> 
[JuliaOliver@localhost ~]$ cd Projects/ <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Projects]$ touch house{1..9} <br /> 
[JuliaOliver@localhost Projects]$ ls *house* <br />
house1  house2  house3  house4  house5  house6  house7  house8  house9 <br />


2. Make the $HOME/projects/houses/doors/ directory path. Create the following empty files within this directory path 
(try using absolute and relative paths from your home directory): <br />
$HOME/projects/houses/bungalow.txt <br />
$HOME/projects/houses/doors/bifold.txt <br />
$HOME/projects/outdoors/vegetation/landscape.txt <br /> 

[JuliaOliver@localhost Projects]$ mkdir Houses <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Projects]$ touch /home/JuliaOliver/Projects/Houses/bungalow.txt <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Projects]$ cd Houses/ <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Houses]$ ls <br />
bungalow.txt <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Houses]$ mkdir Doors <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Houses]$ touch /home/JuliaOliver/Projects/Houses/Doors/bifold.txt <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Houses]$ cd Doors/ <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Doors]$ ls <br />
bifold.txt <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Doors]$ cd /home/JuliaOliver/Projects/ <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Projects]$ mkdir -p Outdoors/Vegetation <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Projects]$ touch /home/JuliaOliver/Projects/Outdoors/Vegetation/landscape.txt <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Projects]$ cd Outdoors/Vegetation/ <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Vegetation]$ ls <br />
landscape.txt <br />


3. Copy the files house1 and house5 to the $HOME/projects/houses/ directory.

[JuliaOliver@localhost Vegetation]$ cd /home/JuliaOliver/Projects/ <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Projects]$ cp -r house1 ./Houses/ <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Projects]$ cp -r house5 ./Houses/ <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Projects]$ cd Houses/ <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Houses]$ ls <br />
bungalow.txt  Doors  house1  house5 <br />


4. Remove the files house6, house7, and house8 without being prompted.

[JuliaOliver@localhost Houses]$ cd .. <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Projects]$ rm -f house{6..8} <br />
[JuliaOliver@localhost Projects]$ ls <br />
house1  house2  house3  house4  house5  house9  Houses  Outdoors <br />
